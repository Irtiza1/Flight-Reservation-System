![flight](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aac9b4ec-56d8-45bb-b454-9e27a320864f)

**Introduction:**

With the increasing prevalence of air travel, it is essential to prioritize the convenience of air journeys. This entails time, cost, comfort, layovers, and customer service. A significant portion of an air traveler's experience is influenced by time and cost. Travelers typically prefer the shortest and most cost-effective routes to their destinations. To address this challenge, we are developing a console-based application aimed at providing customers with the most efficient routes to their destinations, optimizing both time and cost.

**Data Structures and Algorithms:**

This project will primarily utilize 'Graphs' as the foundational data structure and Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the most efficient and shortest routes. However, we may also employ other data structures like Hashing and lists if they are deemed suitable for specific use cases.

**Prominent and Side Features:**

The primary feature of this project, as the name suggests, is to find the shortest route to a customer's destination while minimizing costs. In addition to this core functionality, there are several side features that can enhance the complexity and user experience:
1.	Incorporating Real-World Airlines and Airports: The application will include real-world airlines and airports to provide users with a realistic and comprehensive travel experience.
2.	Defining Various Classes: Users will have the option to choose from various classes such as First Class, Premium, Economy, etc., allowing for a more tailored travel experience.
3.	Flight Search and Reservation: Users can search for available flights, select their preferred routes, and make reservations, streamlining the booking process.
4.	Displaying Flight Details: The application will display essential information about available flights, including routes, fares, layover times, and more, ensuring transparency for the user.
5.	User-Friendly Interface: A user-friendly interface will be developed to ensure smooth and efficient interaction with the application.
These are just a few of the features we plan to include, and as the project progresses, we will incorporate additional features based on evolving requirements and feedback from our instructors and peers
